# Code Snippets from C How to Program, 8th Edition

[C How to Program](https://www.amazon.com/How-Program-8th-Paul-Deitel/dp/0133976890) is my first book on C programming. It helped me a lot to understand fundamental concepts of computer programming.

This repository contains code snippets from the book. The code snippets are organized by chapters. Each chapter has its own directory. The code snippets are named according to the figure numbers in the book.

## How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
