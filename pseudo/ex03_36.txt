Top: Projects the estimated world population after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years

First refinement:
    INITIALIZE variables
    CALCULATE estimated world population
    DISPLAY projections

Second refinement:
    SET unsigned integer pop_total to 7,890,826,950
    SET float growth_rate to 0.0103 
    SET unsigned integer pop_increase to 0
    SET unsigned integer year to 1
    
    WHILE year less than or equal to 5
        CALCULATE pop_increase by multiplying pop_total and growth_rate
        SET pop_total by adding pop_total and pop_increase
        DISPLAY value of pop_total
        INCREMENT year
    ENDWHILE
