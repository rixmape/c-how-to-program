Top: Calculates person's age, maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range

First refinement:
    DECLARE variables
    OBTAIN present date and person's birthdate
    CALCULATE person's age
    CALCULATE person's maximum heart rate
    CALCULATE person's target-heart-rate range
    DISPLAY results

Second refinement:
    DECLARE integer currrent_month, currrent_day and currrent_year
    DECLARE integer bdate_month, bdate_day and bdate_year
    DECLARE integer age, max_hrate, min_target_hrate, max_target_hrate

    OBTAIN currrent_month, currrent_day and currrent_year
    OBTAIN bdate_month, bdate_day and bdate_year

    CALCULATE age by subtracting bdate_year from currrent_year
    CALCULATE max_hrate by subtracting age from 220
    CALCULATE min_target_hrate by multiplying max_hrate to 0.5
    CALCULATE max_target_hrate by multiplying max_hrate to 0.85

    DISPLAY age
    DISPLAY max_hrate
    DISPLAY max_target_hrate
